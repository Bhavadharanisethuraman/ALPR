## Automatic Number Plate Recognition Streamlit Application
- This is a Streamlit application that uses OpenCV and EasyOCR to perform Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) on images. The application is able to detect and recognize license plates from images and display the results in real-time. The application is built using the Streamlit library in Python and can be run locally on your machine.
- OpenCV filtering techniques are used to preprocess the image and extract the license plate region. EasyOCR is then used to recognize the text on the license plate.
